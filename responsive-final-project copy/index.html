                <p p style="color:#ffffff"">Anthony Edward Stark, Or Tony Stark for short is known as Iron Man. Tony is a billionaire, genius, former playboy, philantropist and is also well-known as famous superhero Iron Man, owns Stark Industries - formerly acting as its CEO - lives in his house in Malibu, and is one of the founding and lead members of The Avengers.

            <h2 p style="color:#ffffff"">Here are some of my favorites leadership lessons from Tony Stark.</h2>
            <ol>
                <h3 p style="color:#ffffff"">You have to evolve.</h3>
                <li p style="color:#ffffff"">Despite being a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist, Tony Stark made plenty of mistakes throughout his cinematic journey. But, instead of harping on those mistakes, he learned from them in order to become a better superhero, teammate, and human being. It’s why some have argued that Tony has the most dramatic character arc in the MCU.

                    One example is how he’s continually improving his suit. In Iron Man 2, his suit takes a beating from Whiplash, the antagonist of the film, thanks to his electric whips. In The Avengers when Thor strikes the suit with lightning, it absorbs the energy and uses it against the Asgardian.
                    
                    As a leader, it’s imperative that you learn from your past mistakes. I firmly believe learning to evolve comes from considering your past errors and is one of the best ways to continually improve yourself — so that you don’t repeat the same mistakes over and over again.</li>
   
                    <br>
                    <h3 p style="color:#ffffff"">It's alright to spend time alone.</h3>
                <li p style="color:#ffffff"">Think about when Tony did his best and most impressive work. It was when he was tinkering around in his workshop alone.

                    Obviously, Mr. Stark isn’t an introvert and loves being around others. At the same time, he knew the value of working in solitude because there aren’t any distractions from interrupting you. Additionally, spending time alone sparks creativity, increases productivity, builds mental strength, and makes you more empathetic. All of these are desirable leadership traits to possess.</li>
                    <br>

                    <h3 p style="color:#ffffff"">Surround yourself with the best people.</h3>
                <li p style="color:#ffffff""> Tony doesn’t surround himself with just anyone. Besides Earth’s mightiest heroes, he has the incredibly loyal Happy Hogan and supportive best friend, James Rhodes. There’s also Pepper Potts who is more than capable of taking over the day-to-day operations of Stark Industries.

                    Great leaders are well aware that no matter how talented they are, they surround themselves with amazing people who have unique and diverse skills and perspectives. Even if you don’t always agree with these people in everything — having them around will ultimately make you a stronger and more effective leader.</li>
